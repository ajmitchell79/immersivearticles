  <p><span style="color:#333333;">One of the first things I was taught as a keen young FX trader, back in the
      days when you could smoke or fight on the trading floor and when computer screens were deeper than they
      were wide, was that ‘the trend is your friend.’ That is certainly the case in this year’s Euromoney FX
      survey for those firms that are the beneficiaries of the FX market’s recent evolution.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p><span style="color:#333333;"><br></span></p>
  <p><span style="color:#333333;">For those caught on the wrong side, the trend is much less friendly. </span>

      style="text-decoration:underline;color:#D40915;">JPMorgan</span><span style="color:#333333;"> – only the
      fourth bank ever to have won the survey – is certainly on the right side of things. Up from sixth in 2014,
      when it had an overall share of 5.55%, the bank’s rise has been steady every year under long-time business
      leader Troy Rohrbaugh.</span></p>
