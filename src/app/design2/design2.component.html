        <h5>…if you’re big, fast or specialized in modern foreign exchange. That has led to dramatic changes in the volume-based rankings in our annual survey. Meanwhile, new customer satisfaction ratings give a different insight into the banks’ relationships with their clients.</h5>

                                        One of the first things I was taught as a keen young FX trader, back in the days when you could smoke or fight on the trading floor and when computer screens were deeper than they were wide, was that ‘the trend is your friend.’ That is certainly the case in this year’s Euromoney FX survey for those firms that are the beneficiaries of the FX market’s recent evolution.

                                        For those caught on the wrong side, the trend is much less friendly. 
                                        <p>
                                        This year’s winner by overall market share, JPMorgan – only the fourth bank ever to have won the survey – is certainly on the right side of things. Up from sixth in 2014, when it had an overall share of 5.55%, the bank’s rise has been steady every year under long-time business leader Troy Rohrbaugh.

                                        Its top slot in this survey with a share of 12.13% had an air of predictable inevitability about it. Indeed, in the piece I wrote for last year’s survey I’m happy to say that I did predict it. 
                                        <p>
                                        Much less predictable was the sudden downturn in Citi’s fortunes. Firmly on top of the table in 2014 with 16.04% share, holding on last year with 10.74%, it has now slipped to fifth with just 6.16% – its lowest ranking since 2009.

                                        Its slide is mirrored by the stories of Deutsche Bank and Barclays – powerhouses only four or five years ago – now down to 8th in Deutsche’s case and 11th in Barclays’ (outside the top 10 for the first time since 2001).
                                        <p>
                                        <div  class="item-quote">
                                        It’s like being able to design a stripped down drag racing car where the only goal is speed, while your rivals need to put in a dog box and baby seats
                                        </div>
                                        <p>
                                        But their fall has meant room for new entrants. One of the places in the top five has been taken by electronic market making outfit XTX Markets. First appearing in the rankings in 2015 at 34th, XTX has gained ground ever since; this year it has finished third overall with a 7.36% share. Its e-rival Jump hovers just outside the top 10, with 2.38%. 
                                        <p>
                                        To be fair, the rankings in this year’s survey are not strictly comparable with those of the past. The reason being that this year the methodology has been altered. Swaps less than one week in maturity no longer count towards a firm’s total volume. This has the effect of putting more emphasis on spot and forwards market share in the overall rankings, since short-dated flow is a large part of most firms’ swaps volume. 
                                        <p>
                                        It would be possible to argue at tedious length about the wisdom of re-jigging the survey this way. I personally think it makes sense since – some emerging currencies aside – ultra-short dated swaps have very little to do with a firm’s real prowess in the sharp end of FX. In any case, it makes no difference to JPMorgan’s victory, the US bank would have won under the old rules too, although it does flatter XTX.
