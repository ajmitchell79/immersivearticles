                        <h3>Same pattern</h3>
                        <p>Even with that caveat, what is still clear is that all these movements in the rankings – the consolidation of the hold of JPMorgan, the <a href="/article/b18b4092t4r6yc/fx-survey-2018-banks-retreat-to-forex-niches">rise of specialist</a> e-market makers and the fall of intermediate-sized full-service firms – are part of the same pattern.</p>
                        <p>There are, and always have been, two broad categories of customer: the kind that just want a price and the kind that see FX as a package of services, often tied up with other things a bank can offer, such as loans or origination. </p>
                        <p>For those customers who just want a price – as convenient, tight and reliable as possible – the new e-market makers have some inherent advantages over incumbents. </p>
                        <p>No legacy systems to try to work around, just a nice clean sheet of paper. No bank firewalls or interminable committees to negotiate. No regulatory restraints on pay. </p>
                        <p>It’s like being able to design a stripped down drag racing car where the only goal is speed, while your rivals need to put in a dog box and baby seats. </p>
                        <p>And so, as you might expect, the e-market makers dominate the FX trading platform category, the world of ‘just give me a price’. HCTech at third and Jump Trading at number three both have very decent totals (9.61% and 7.03% respectively), but XTX wins the category with a startling 18.49%. XTX’s position is not just about volumes. In the newly instituted customer satisfaction (CSAT) survey, the firm gets stellar marks in virtually every category. </p><p>What is more, it is not just in developed markets that the newcomers shine, they have also started to make a serious showing in the less developed markets. In emerging markets, XTX comes in at number three just behind such sector stalwarts as Standard Chartered and JPMorgan. </p><p>This should be a worrying sign for banks that might have thought that the wrinkles and peculiarities of emerging currencies would not suit robots. But maybe, with machine learning able to see complex patterns and connections that no human trader can realistically follow, this arena is actually even more suited to the machines’ advantages than the more liquid and heavily traded G20.</p>
